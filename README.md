# menunico
A menu-of-the-day discovery application built on react native. 

# Getting Started 
## Install Android SDK and JDK
This will vary from platform to platform. Follow the instructions on the getting started page of react native
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

For OSX you will need watchman to get hot-loading support. 

# Running 
## Android Emulator 
Make sure you have an emulator set up. You can manage your emulators via `android avd`. 

Running `npm run android` will automatically set-up and launch the emulator and install the application on any connected development devices 

`npm run ios` does the same for iOS however it will only spawn a simulator instance. Be aware that you will require XCode
